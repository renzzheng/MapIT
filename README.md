## Inspiration
Frustrated by how many websites still lack proper Google Map locators or address links for nearby locations, I decided to build a tool to resolve the problem myself. While trying to look up Gachapon locations and Pokémon vending machines in California, I noticed there was little to no UI/UX support for helping users conveniently map out which locations were closest to them. These weren’t the first cases I’d seen, so I envisioned `MapIt` as a fast, lightweight solution to this inconvenience.
